# Machine Learning Algorithms

This repository contains a collection of Machine Learning algorithms implemented in Python programming language. Each algorithm is organized in its own directory, providing detailed explanations and code examples.

## Algorithms implemented
  * **k-Nearest Neighbors**
  * **Linear Regression**
  * **Logistic Regression**

## Installation and usage.

This project has 3 dependencies.

- `numpy` for the maths implementation and writing the algorithms
- `Scikit-learn` for the data generation and testing.
- `Pandas` for loading data

You can install these dependencies using

```sh
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**NOTE**: Only `numpy` is used for the implementations.
