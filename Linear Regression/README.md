# Linear Regression Algorithm

Linear Regression is a widely used algorithm in machine learning and statistics for predicting a continuous target variable based on one or more input features. It assumes a linear relationship between the input features and the target variable.

## Algorithm Description
1. **Data Preparation**: Linear Regression requires a dataset with input features (independent variables) and the corresponding target variable (dependent variable). The dataset is typically split into a training set and a test set.
2. **Model Training**: The algorithm fits a line or a hyperplane to the training data by finding the best coefficients that minimize the difference between the predicted values and the actual values. This process is known as "training" the model.
3. **Model Evaluation**: Once the model is trained, it is evaluated using the test set to measure its performance. Common evaluation metrics for regression problems include mean squared error (MSE), root mean squared error (RMSE), and coefficient of determination (R-squared).
4. **Prediction**: After the model is trained and evaluated, it can be used to make predictions on new, unseen data. Given the input features, the model calculates the predicted target variable using the learned coefficients.
